# heart_disease


The Heart Disease Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data. It utilizes Python, machine learning algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques to analyze key health indicators and provide predictive insights.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ” Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing data.

âœ” Feature Engineering: Selects relevant medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate.

âœ” Machine Learning Model: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or other ML algorithms for classification.

âœ” Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

âœ” Deployment-Ready Code: Structured Python script that can be integrated into applications or APIs for real-world use.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

âœ… Programming Language: Python

âœ… Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib (if visualization is included)

âœ… Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest

ðŸ”¹ Impact & Applications:

ðŸ“Œ Helps predict heart disease risk early, aiding doctors in diagnosis and prevention.

ðŸ“Œ Can be integrated into healthcare systems or mobile applications for real-time predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Provides a data-driven approach to medical decision-making.
